## What is Vibe Coding?

[Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) is an AI-assisted programming approach where users describe their problem in natural language, and AI generates the necessary code without requiring the developer to deeply understand or engage with detailed code logic. The term was coined by AI researcher **Andrej Karpathy** in February 2025.

### Paradigm Comparison

| Paradigm | Approach | Human Role | Best For |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Traditional Coding** | Manual syntax-based writing | Writes/reads all code | Full control, production systems |
| **AI-Assisted Coding** | LLM suggests, human reviews/edits | Reviews and refines code | Faster development with oversight |
| **Vibe Coding** | Natural language to AI, test-only evaluation | Guides via intent, tests outcomes | Rapid prototyping, MVPs |

---

## Key Principles

- **Natural Language First** — Describe what you want, not how to implement it
- **Specification vs Vibe** — Loose, intent-driven descriptions over exhaustive specs
- **Context Management** — Maintain state across multi-turn conversations
- **Responsibility Boundaries** — Humans handle judgment/testing; AI handles generation
- **Trust Building** — Iterative testing and feedback foster reliance on AI outputs
- **Embrace Uncertainty** — Accept AI code based on tests, not line-by-line review

## Workflows & Templates

| Workflow | Key Steps |
|----------|-----------|
| **New Feature** | Vibe Brief → Verify with PRD → Vertical slice plan → Implement stepwise |
| **Refactoring** | Analyze patterns/smells → Safety strategy → Sequential small steps |
| **Bug Fixing** | Triage & hypotheses → Minimal failing test → Fix → Verify |
| **Test Generation** | Identify critical behaviors → Prioritize by risk → Generate tests |

**Recommended Artifacts**: PRD.md, TECH_DESIGN.md, NOTES.md, CHANGELOG.md

📚 **[Full Workflows & Templates Guide →](docs/workflows-and-templates.md)** — Session setup, prompt templates, playbooks

---

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Start with context** — Provide architecture, constraints, relevant code
- **Decompose tasks** — Break into planning → generation → testing → refactoring
- **Test first** — Generate tests before or alongside code
- **Use sandboxes** — Run AI code in isolated environments
- **Review as "junior engineer"** — Always human-review for security and architecture
- **Maintain artifacts** — Keep PRD, NOTES, CHANGELOG updated

### Don'ts ❌

- **Skip review for "simple" code** — AI can introduce subtle bugs
- **Include secrets in prompts** — Use environment variables or vaults
- **Feed proprietary code to public models** — Risk of data leakage
- **Accept raw output blindly** — Vibe ≠ vibes without verification
- **Over-rely on AI for complex decisions** — Humans handle judgment

### How to Contribute

1. **Open an Issue** — [Create a new issue](../../issues/new) with your suggestion
   - New tool or resource to add
   - Correction or update to existing content
   - New category or section idea
2. **Describe Your Suggestion** — Include name, URL, and brief description
3. **Automatic Processing** — Once a maintainer comments `/approve`, Claude Code automatically adds the resource, generates translations, and commits to main

> **Please submit issues, not pull requests.** This repository is AI-operated — Claude Code handles all content editing, formatting, and translation (English, Korean, Japanese) to ensure consistency. Direct PRs will likely cause merge conflicts with the automated pipeline.
